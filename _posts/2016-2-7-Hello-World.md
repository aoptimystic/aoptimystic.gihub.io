title: Security - where you need to have your cake and eat it too.

Being in Software and Security is a tricky thing to do. On one hand you're supposed to code apps which are not only secure, but also usable and efficient. On the other hand you're also supposed to test the same apps for vulnerabilities, threats and possible exploits which can make your code go nuts. Its often a role wherein you wear multiple hats according to the situation you're in and do your best to achieve the team's objective. 

Being in the industry for nearly two years now, I have observed different companies taking a different approach to Security. Some prefer building Security into the development process, wherein you have a Security Engineer working with the devs, test the code from the word go and find bugs. These are what we call Security QA/pen test guys who don't really like writing too much code, but rather break the code apart to find bugs and send the developer back to get it fixed before moving on. The other kind, is what I call the Security designers, who actually architect how the Software should behave and define its Security perimeter. Its not uncommon, in this case, for the person in question to code the system from the ground up and get their hands dirty. As far as bug finding is concerned, the QA looks at the entire SDLC. 

But when people look for Software Security Engineer to join their team, it is obvious that they want a Coder extra-ordinaire who also doubles up as a Security expert. Just knowing how to write good, efficient code while being superflous about Security fundamentals doesn't work, as doesn't being the go-to guy for Elliptical Curve Crypto and not knowing how to reverse a string efficiently :) So you not only need to know how to write thread safe code in Java and find out bugs like an Anteater finds termites when presented with a code snippet but also recite how SAML works and ROP functions like you've swallowed your college text book whole! Definitely not something I can back myself up with! 

Throughout this blog I will talk about the daily realities in being in Software and Security and share my experiences with respect to the technology stack that I come across. Until then, if you're a Software Security Engineer, pat yourself on your back and don't be too hard on yourself if you can't find too many vulnerabilities in 10 page long Java code or can't remember specifics of oAuth. Its tough to keep up with this many headed monster and the learning never stops :) 

Happy fighting!
